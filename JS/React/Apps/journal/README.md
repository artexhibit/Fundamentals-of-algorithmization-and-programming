## About

College homework to create a `React` app, where received knowledge would be practiced.

## Task

Implement functionality of a simple Personal Blog.

1. Implement filling out the fields with the Send button;
2. When you click the Send button, a JournalItem component should be created (on the left side) with a brief description: title, date, short text;
3. When you click on the New Record button, the input fields should be cleared;
4. Implement the presence of only 5 cards on the left side. When a new one (6th) appears, the oldest one should be deleted.

* Additionally I added an online database to store the data (`Supabase`). If fetching data fails, the app uses a predifined data:
