## About

College homework to work with `React` props and `useState` hook. 

## Task

1. Create a `Form` component;
2. Create `input` components inside (3-4);
3. Make an event handler `onChange / onInput` - receive user input;
4. Write output data inside `span` and show it below the form (save input in a `state`);
5. Implement inputs validation on the form at the client level:
- if the user enters a password of less than 6 characters, the input turns red and an error message appears below;
- the send button becomes inactive.

Implement such validation on different types of inputs.
